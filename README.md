Hi, I'm Sam Ludford! ðŸ‘‹
I'm @sam-ludford on GitHub, and I'm passionate about the intricate world of trading systems architecture.

My current focus is on developing institutional-grade Expert Advisors (EAs) for MetaTrader 4 (MT4). I'm actively looking to collaborate with others who share this interest and want to build robust, high-performance trading solutions.

Let's Connect!
If you're interested in collaborating or just want to chat about trading systems and MT4 EAs, feel free to reach out to me via email:
